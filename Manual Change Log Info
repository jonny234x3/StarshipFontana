Repositioned the Walls
Updated Collisions
- Player to Wall, however no effect
- Player to Collectable, Respawn collectable
- Player to Alien, Player respawn
Re-Updated Collisions
- Player to Collectable, Hides, doesn't destory

Fixed player to edge of screen collision

April 24th
FILES EDITED - SFApp.cpp, SFApp.h, SFAssest.cpp & SFAssest.h
Updated Collisions
- Alien to Wall, prevents Alien spawning under a wall
- Player to Coin, Destories Coin.
Added similar code to destory the projectiles after they have hit top of screen

Alien's random respawn now is within a set space
- new problem is aliens can spawn above a wall segment so a player cannot kill them

Added a scoring system

Created four new collectable items with an counter which is set to go to an end game screen upon all items being collected under SFApp::OnUpdateWorld

Added 3 new projectiles to go left, down and right
- was having an issue with use of for statements and "auto" so have had to use copies of similar code for simplicity
- problem with arrows not deleting at the wall, now fixed


NEED TO DO
- FIX sRGB files
- create the new projectile png files
- Create congrats screen
- Update skeletons spawn location (go slightly off right)
- change gem location
- make the map more complex

- play test
